# Feed the Boars modpack
This modpack is a friendpack and for now meant to enhance the vanilla Valheim experience and make it a bit less tedious to play the game. It also enhances network capabilities and balances a couple of mods to ensure nothing feels overpowered.

#### Quick summary of things:
- Skills for every aspect of the game
- Dual wielding of same type weapons
- Better archery
- Server admin commands
- Plantable berries, mushrooms, and even flint, stones, and wood
